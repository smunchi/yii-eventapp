<img style="vertical-align: middle; float: left" src="<?php echo Yii::app()->baseurl ?>/images/people_group.png" alt="People Group Photo" width="100"/>
<span style="float: left; width: 80%; padding: 30px 15px;">It helps to connect with a specific group of people for a perticular event. For example, you have an upcomming event in your school and you want a platform so that people can join and communicate with each others.</span>
